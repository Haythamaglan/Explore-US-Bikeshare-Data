# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Basic Udacity project to explore bikeshare data using pandas
# Project Overview
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
# What Software needed to run this program?
In order to run this program you need to have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda or using the command 'python bikeshare.py' on your terminal
# Project Details
The program takes user input for the city (e.g. Chicago), month for which the user wants to view data (e.g. May; also includes an 'all' option for no month filter), and day for which the user wants to view data (e.g. Sunday; also includes an 'all' option for no day filter). Upon receiving the user input, it goes ahead and asks the user if they want to view the raw data (5 rows of data initially) or not. Following the input received, the program prints the following details:

Most popular month
Most popular day
Most popular hour
Most popular start station
Most popular end station
Most popular combination of start and end stations
Total trip duration time
Average trip duration time
Maximum trip duration time
Minimum trip duration time
Types of users by number
Types of users by gender (if available) - The oldest user (if available) -
The youngest user (if available)
The most common birth year amongst users (if available)
Finally, the user is prompted with the choice of restarting the program or not.
# Project Data
All data provided by Udacity:

chicago.csv - Stored in the data folder, the chicago.csv file is the dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Chicago.
new_york_city.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of New York.
washington.csv - Dataset containing all bikeshare information for the city of Washington. Note: washington doesn't include the 'Gender' or 'Birth Year' informations.
